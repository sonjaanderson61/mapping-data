While Queens, Brooklyn and especially Manhattan have many places dedicated to LGBT nightlife, the Bronx has one gay bar.

That bar is called Identity, and it’s run by Aidan Loughran. It opened in June of 2021.

“It's just difficult when you're up against Manhattan,” Loughran said. “If you've got one bar in the Bronx, and you've got 30 or 40 bars in the city, you're going to go to Manhattan and bounce around, you know?”

Loughran said that being the only gay bar in the borough means he must cater to many different identities, and that’s a turn-off for some patrons who prefer a bar that serves strictly gay men.

To the Bronx’s one gay bar, Staten Island has zero. Staten Island’s population is 475,596, though, while the Bronx’s is 1.427 million.

 <div class="box"> <p id="method"> Notes on methodology:
To gather data for this map, I used the scraping application Octoparse. I chose a task template that was formulated for Google Maps and did keyword searches for lesbian and gay bars, LGBT bars and nightclubs in each borough. The application compiled a list of all the results and deleted duplicates. I did this several times with different search terms and radiuses, then combined the results in an excel sheet and pared it down. I removed duplicates and researched individual bars to verify their status as a gay bar. </p>
